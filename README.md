# Off-by-One Error in Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array.  The error occurs in the `BuggyArraySum.java` file, while the correction is shown in `CorrectedArraySum.java`.

The off-by-one error is a classic programming mistake that often leads to unexpected behavior or exceptions.  It happens when the loop counter goes beyond the valid index range of the array, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. 

Understanding and avoiding these errors is crucial for writing robust and reliable code.
